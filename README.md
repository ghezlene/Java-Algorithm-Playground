# Java-Algorithm-Playground
**Description:**  
This Java console application offers a collection of classic algorithm implementations organized into multiple classes by problem category.  
The **Main** class provides an interactive menu for users to select operations, input data, and view results.  

## Features

The project includes algorithm implementations grouped by category:

- **Simple Operations**  
  Factorial, Prime Checking, Palindrome Check, Fibonacci Series, etc.

- **Array Operations**  
  Find Largest Element, Bubble Sort, Linear Search, Remove Duplicates, Merge Sort, etc.
  
- **String Operations**  
  Vowel and Consonant Counting, Longest Word, Balanced Parentheses, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), etc.

- **Problem Solving**  
  Two Sum, Coin Change Problem, and other classic algorithmic challenges.

  etc...

  ## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher  
- Terminal or command line interface

  ## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone -b
2. Compile all Java files:
     ```bash
     javac *.java

3. run the main class:
   ```bash
   java main
## Purpose
This project showcases:

- Modular Java application design using multiple classes
- Implementation of a variety of algorithms across different domains
- Console-based user interaction with menus and input handling
- Clean, maintainable code organized by functionality
